## What is Dagger?

It's about Dependency Injection framework(??) by Google Inc.

Also, it is a weapon.

**Note : ** 
__I plan to learn new stuff this way. I simply write down whatever I read or understand about the `New thing` that I'm learning. Just throw all the stuff that's in my head onto this document/page. Then re-read it and correct myself. 
Right now, it sounds like a great idea!

Also, will add a Disqus section so that the `Lords of the New Thing` can correct me. Or they can also create a pull request, if they are the `Nice lords`__

### What is dependency injection?

- Injecting dependencies rather than creating them yourself. (Using `@Inject`)
- Asking someone else to give us the needs. (i.e, `@Component`)
- Telling the world( or @Component) that I'll provide the dependencies (`@Module`). Functions

### Plan

Build an android app using Dagger2.

What to build?
    - Weather app? Classes - Weather, Location, 
    - Todo app? Classes - Note, Dashboard/ Collection, Form/Editor, NoteType
    - Music app, yeah let's do this. Got some ideas. Also, haven't built a music app before. Getting a feeling that this might get complicated soon with stuff that is completely unrelated to Dagger and I might spend more time on that(Media session, media that, media this bla blah)
    - Memes. Yep that's the one.
